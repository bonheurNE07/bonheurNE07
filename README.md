ðŸŽ¯ **Backend Developer** with a strong foundation in electronics and telecommunications, passionate about building reliable and scalable systems that connect software with the physical world.

Iâ€™m currently deepening my expertise in networking and cybersecurity, which shape how I approach backend development â€” with a strong focus on performance, connectivity, and secure architectures.

Alongside this, Iâ€™m exploring Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to understand how intelligent systems can be integrated into backend solutions and networked environments.
