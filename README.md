**Backend Developer** with a strong foundation in electronics and telecommunications, passionate about building reliable and scalable systems that connect software with the physical world.

I’m currently deepening my expertise in networking and cybersecurity, which shape how I approach backend development — with a strong focus on performance, connectivity, and secure architectures.

Alongside this, I’m exploring Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to understand how intelligent systems can be integrated into backend solutions and networked environments.
